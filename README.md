# Quiz App Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

The Quiz App is a dynamic and interactive game built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Leveraging the Open Trivia Database API, it presents a variety of quiz questions covering multiple categories and difficulty levels. Users answer one question at a time and can navigate between them, even changing their answers before submitting. The app tracks the time spent on each question and provides a detailed summary at the end, including a visual breakdown of correct and incorrect answers, previous quiz results, and other performance statistics via interactive charts using Chart.js.
